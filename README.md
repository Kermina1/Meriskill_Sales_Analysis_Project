`January to April:` Sales showed a steady growth from January to April which suggest a positive growth trend in first quarter of the year.

`May to September:` Sales started to decrease from May to Septmber which suggest a mid year drip which might be due to reduced demand.

`October to December:` There was a strong increase in end of year quarter (Q4) with highest peak in December, that suggest an in increase demand possibly due to holiday season.

- Lowest: January and September are the lowest points of the year.
